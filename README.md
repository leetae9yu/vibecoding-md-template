# vibecoding-md-template
Collection of MD files I use for my Vibe-Coding

### CONSTITUTION.md
It defines the whole workflow rule.
My workflow goes like
- Build my plans with Planner
- Planner divides the project into N Phases
- Planner divides each phase into atomic tasks
- Implementers do their own tasks independently
- Reviewer do code-review, refactoring and ask user to implement next phase.
